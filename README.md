# LoRa-PCB

## Assignment 1
One circuit is given (PNG form), which is supposed to be used as a sensor node. It contains LoRa module, XIAO Esp32 s3 module, DHT11 (temperature & humidity), LDR (Light dependant resistor) and few other basic components. This circuit is used to send Temperature, Humidity and Light intensity values wirelesly over LoRa to Lora Receiver (none of our business).

### Diagram

### Task
All necessary components are mentioned in the circuit, your task is to create the same circuit in your favourite PCB designing software (KiCAD, Eagle Easyeda etc) and then create a final PCB out of it. Please note that there are some requirements are given you need to follow those as well.
1. PCB dimentions - 30x55 mm (rectangle)
2. Spacing between ESP32 headers on the PCB should be 15.24 mm
3. Routing and component placement should be optimized and efficient. 

### Submission 
After completion you need to create a repo of your project work as public and share the link to `electramite@gmail.com`
Also note that below files are mendatory to be present in the repo for successful evaluation of the assignment 

1. PCB layout file
2. Circuit diagram 
3. Screenshots of both 
4. Prepare a small readme along with the attached screenshots (somthing similar to this one).

### NOTE
Above circuit is made in `easyeda` although you are free to use any software of your choice but we recommend using `easyeda`.
